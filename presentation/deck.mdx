# Before we get started

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone github.com/VICEMedia/gdi-typescript-day2
$ cd gdi-typescript-day2/exercise
```

```notes
This is a timeboxed section during which we can briefly review anything the class is fuzzy on from day1
Let's try to limit this to 10-15 mins, and anything beyond that can be discussed during guided practice
```

# This lesson will cover

* union types
* generics
* class inheritance
* React props & states using interfaces
* making a React app using TypeScript & TSX

---

# Union types

```typescript
interface Order {
  amount: number;
  color?: string;
  type: 'rose' | 'tulip';
}
```

---

# Generics

Generics are components that can work over a variety of types instead of just one.

```typescript
const flowers: Flower[] = [new Tulip('pink')];
const flowers: Array<Flower> = [new Tulip('pink')];
```

Let's simplify our `createBouquet()` from the last lesson to use a generic

---

# Inheritance

```typescript
class Waterable {
  ...
}

class Tulip extends Waterable {
  ...
}
```

We can DRY up our `water()` functions

---

# Extending interfaces

Much like classes can extend other classes in JavaScript, interfaces can extend other interfaces.

Extending interfaces can help keep type definitions DRY, and make components more reuseable.

```typescript
interface ThornyFlower extends Flower {
  thorns: number;
}
```

---

# Let's make a react app!

---

# create-react-app

```bash
$ npm init react-app flowershop --typescript
$ cd flowershop
$ npm start
```

```notes
we'll do this in the following order:
1) make a blank OrderComponent with inputs
2) create select options that map to a union type
3) give it a state to track user input
4) give it a submit handler that calls a handle submit passed down by the parent component
5) allow the students use our already existing createOrder function to create the order
6) allow the students to work on their own to create a view of all of the purchased flowers
```
